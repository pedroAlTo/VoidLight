# VoidLight – Keeper's Companion

VoidLight is a browser-based campaign management tool for tabletop RPG sessions built around a Hope/Fear duality style of play. It helps Keepers track characters, scenes, clocks, dice results, and campaign data in one place.

## Highlights

- Campaign selection screen (new campaign, templates, tutorial).
- Dashboard with scene tracker, active clocks, party status, spotlight focus, and keeper moves.
- Dedicated tabs for Players, NPCs, Monsters, Scenes, Clocks, Dice, and Notes.
- Save/load campaigns as JSON files (export/import supported).
- Optional Player Mode to hide keeper-only information.

## Tech

- HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript
- No backend; everything runs locally in the browser

## Quick start (local)

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Create a new campaign or load a template.

> Tip: If your browser restricts local file behavior, run a simple local server:
>
> - `python -m http.server 8000`
> - then open `http://localhost:8000/`
