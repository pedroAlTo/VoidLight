# VoidLight User Guide

This guide is organized into three levels to reduce cognitive load:

1. **Basic** — first session setup.
2. **Intermediate** — deeper features and better workflows.
3. **Expert** — designing long arcs (clocks, scenes, environments) and reusable campaign content.

---

## 1) Basic (first session)

### Start a campaign

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Choose **New Campaign** to start from a blank state, or **Browse Campaigns** to load a template.
3. Set the campaign/session name in the header field.

### Understand the main areas

- **Dashboard**: your session hub.
- **Tabs**: Players, NPCs, Monsters, Scenes, Clocks, Dice, Notes.
- **Keeper Mode toggle**: hides/reveals keeper-only info.

### Add characters

- Go to **Players** → **Add Player**.
- For NPCs and Monsters, use the **NPCs** and **Monsters** tabs.
- Track HP/Stress/Hope and armor slots during play.

### Create a clock

- Go to **Clocks**.
- Add a clock with 4/6/8 segments.
- Increase/decrease segments as the situation evolves.

### Use the dice roller

- Go to **Dice**.
- Use the Duality roller for Hope/Fear outcomes.
- Use d20 and damage dice as needed.

### Save / load

- Use **Save** to export a JSON snapshot.
- Use **Load** to restore from a JSON file.

---

## 2) Intermediate (power user workflows)

### Scenes

Create scenes with:

- Name + location
- Atmosphere (read-aloud)
- Objectives (one per line)
- Key rolls (one per line)
- NPCs present
- Possible outcomes
- Keeper tips

Use the scene tracker on the Dashboard to jump between scenes.

### Dashboard pinning

Pin frequently-used NPCs/monsters to keep them visible in the Dashboard.

### Partial import/export

Use the Export/Import tools to move only specific sections (players, NPCs, monsters, scenes, clocks) between campaigns.

### Keeper vs Player mode

- Keeper Mode: full control.
- Player Mode: hides hidden NPCs, keeper notes, and other secrets.

---

## 3) Expert (arcs, complex prep)

### Designing arcs with clocks

Use clocks as long-term pressure trackers:

- **4 segments**: fast tension (one scene).
- **6 segments**: one session arc.
- **8 segments**: multi-session arc.

Define what each segment means and what happens when the clock fills.

### Building scenes as “beats”

For each scene, define:

- The *question* the scene answers.
- What changes on Success with Hope / Success with Fear / Failure with Hope / Failure with Fear.
- Which clocks advance and why.

### Reusable campaign content

Create libraries you can re-use:

- Scene templates (investigation, chase, negotiation, boss fight).
- NPC archetypes (ally, rival, traitor, quest giver).
- Monster sets by tier.

Export these sections to JSON and import them into new campaigns.
